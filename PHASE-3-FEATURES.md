# 📋 Apna Transport — Phase 3 Roadmap & Audit Tracker

> **Last Updated:** May 19, 2026
> **Status:** Implementation In Progress

## 🔒 Security Audit (Sprint 1 — COMPLETED ✅)

| # | Issue | Status | Files Changed |
|---|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | ~~Plaintext password storage in `defaultPassword`~~ | ✅ Fixed | `owners.ts` |
| 2 | ~~Auth credential logging in production~~ | ✅ Fixed | `auth.ts` |
| 3 | ~~Owner portal missing auth guard~~ | ✅ Fixed | `owner/page.tsx` |
| 4 | ~~Centralized `revalidatePath` helper~~ | ✅ Fixed | All 9 action files |

### Changes Made
- **Plaintext Passwords**: `defaultPassword` field now always writes `null` — no new plaintext values stored
- **Auth Logging**: Removed 4 `console.log` statements exposing emails and password match results
- **Owner Portal**: Added explicit `role === 'OWNER'` check with redirect to `/login`
- **Revalidation**: Created `revalidate.ts` with `revalidateDashboard()` helper; replaced ~30 manual `revalidatePath()` calls across 9 files

---

## 💰 Financial Accuracy (Sprint 2 — COMPLETED ✅)

| # | Issue | Status | Files Changed |
|---|-------|--------|---------------|
| 5 | ~~Settlement rate logic using wrong fallback~~ | ✅ Fixed | `settlements.ts` |

### Changes Made
- **Settlement Rate Chain**: Fixed `generateSettlement` to properly use `vehicle.ownerRateOverride → owner.ownerRateOverride → vehicle.project.ownerRate → defaultRate` chain (was grabbing a random recent project rate)

---

## ⚡ Production Hardening (Sprint 3 — COMPLETED ✅)

| # | Issue | Status | Files Changed |
|---|-------|--------|---------------|
| 6 | ~~Owner portal loads unbounded data~~ | ✅ Fixed | `owner/page.tsx` |
| 7 | ~~Owner deletion race condition~~ | ✅ Fixed | `owners.ts` |
| 8 | ~~No error boundaries on dashboard tabs~~ | ✅ Fixed | `DashboardAnalytics.tsx`, NEW: `TabErrorBoundary.tsx` |

### Changes Made
- **Owner Portal Pagination**: Added `take: 25` for trips, `take: 20` for expenses per vehicle + `_count` for total tracking
- **Owner Deletion Safety**: Wrapped in `prisma.$transaction` — now cleans up `OwnerAdvance`, `Settlement`, then `Owner`, then `User` atomically
- **Tab Error Boundaries**: Created `TabErrorBoundary.tsx` class component; wrapped Activity, P&L, and Simulator tabs to isolate rendering failures

## 🎨 UI/UX & Performance (Sprint 4 — COMPLETED ✅)

| # | Improvement | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 9 | ~~P&L tab values truncated (₹13,3...)~~ | ✅ Fixed |
| 10 | ~~Waterfall bars too thin~~ | ✅ Fixed |
| 11 | ~~P&L KPI layout cramped~~ | ✅ Fixed |
| 12 | ~~No skeleton loading on dashboard~~ | ✅ Fixed |
| 13 | ~~Analytics fires 30 DB queries~~ | ✅ Optimized → 22 queries |

### Changes Made
- **P&L Complete Redesign**: Full-width headline banner, smart number formatter (K/L/Cr), thicker waterfall bars with glow, responsive 3-col grid
- **Skeleton Loading**: Replaced spinner with rich shimmer skeleton matching dashboard layout (KPI cards, charts, table rows)
- **Query Optimization**: Consolidated 4 duplicate trip queries into 1, merged 2 cash flow aggregates into 1 grouped query, removed redundant company expense aggregate. Added 5000-row safety cap on trip fetch
